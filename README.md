## Branching

This will list ways to branch, and notes on branching.

'git branch'- - list branches, highlighting the one you're on.
'git checkout BRANCH_NAME' - start working on that branch.
'git branch BRANCH_NAME' - create your branch.

`git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME` - create a branch _and_ checkout that branch.
